“Heterogeneity and dynamics of DENV-specific CD8⁺ T cells in dengue infection”

Project Overview

Background
Dengue virus (DENV) causes a wide spectrum of outcomes, from asymptomatic infection to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The contribution of DENV-specific CD8⁺ T cells to protection versus pathogenesis remains unresolved.

Approach

Tetramer-based sorting of CD8⁺ T cells recognizing immunodominant NS3 epitopes restricted by HLA-A11:01 and HLA-A24:02

Single-cell transcriptome and TCR repertoire profiling of tetramer-sorted cells using the Smart-Seq2 (SS2) platform from patients with asymptomatic dengue (AD), dengue fever (DF), and DHF

Integration with PBMC datasets generated by 10x Genomics (10x) single-cell sequencing

Computational analysis using Scanpy and Scirpy for combined transcriptome–TCR analysis

Goal
To characterize the heterogeneity of dengue-specific CD8⁺ T cells — including TCR repertoire usage, clonal expansion, transcriptional states, and cell–cell communication networks — and link these features to clinical disease severity.
